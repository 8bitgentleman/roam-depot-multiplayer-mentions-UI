# Roam Research Enhanced Multiplayer Mentions

Roam Research Enhanced Multiplayer Mentions assists common multiplayer graph mentions notation, making it easier to track, categorize, and respond to your mentions across your knowledge base.

## Features

### Dynamic Mention States

- Multiplayer Mentions creates a dropdown menu next to mentions of the configured page name.
- This dropdown allows you to quickly change the state of the mention without manually editing the block.

### Customizable Notification States

- By default, the extension comes with four pre-configured states:
  - ðŸš¨ Notify: Marks the mention for immediate attention
  - âœ… Mark Read: Indicates you've seen and processed the mention
  - ðŸ“¨ CC: Marks the mention as an FYI
  - ðŸ’¾ Bookmark: Saves the mention for later reference
- You can customize these states, add new ones, or remove existing ones through the settings panel.

## Configuration

Multiplayer Mentions can be configured through the Roam Depot settings panel:

1. **Page To Watch**: Set the name of the page you want to monitor for mentions.
2. **Notification States**: Manage your custom notification states.
   - Add new states with custom names and prefixes
   - Reorder states to prioritize frequently used options
   - Delete states you no longer need

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure you've set a valid "Page To Watch" in the settings.
2. Check that you have at least one notification state configured.
3. Try reloading the extension.
